# Movie Dashboard App

A React-based web app that allows users to search for movies, view detailed information. Built with React, React Query, and styled with Tailwind CSS.


## Project Overview

This app provides a smooth user experience for searching movies and display statistics . It fetches data from a public movie API `[https://www.freetestapi.com/api/v1/movies]` and updates search results dynamically as the user types. The app leverages React Query for efficient data fetching.
